🧾 How It Works

When the program starts, you’ll see a menu with four options:
Add a new flashcard
View all flashcards
Start a quiz
Exit the app
Each flashcard contains a question and an answer.
Flashcards are saved automatically in a local file named flashcards.json.
In Quiz Mode, a random flashcard is displayed, and you type your answer to check your knowledge.

🌟 Future Improvements

Build a graphical (GUI) version using Tkinter or PyQt
