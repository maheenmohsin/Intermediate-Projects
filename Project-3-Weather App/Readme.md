🌦️ Weather App – Python Project
📖 Overview

The Weather App is a simple yet powerful Python-based application that allows users to fetch real-time weather information for any city in the world 🌍.
It uses the OpenWeather API to display live temperature, feels-like temperature, and weather conditions directly in the terminal.

This project is designed for intermediate Python learners who want to practice working with APIs, JSON data, and user input handling.

🚀 Features

✅ Fetches live weather data for any city
✅ Displays temperature, feels-like temperature, and conditions
✅ User-friendly terminal interface
✅ Handles invalid city names and API errors gracefully
✅ Built with clean and reusable Python code

🧰 Technologies Used

Python 3
Requests Library (for API communication)
OpenWeather API (for real-time data)

⚙️ How It Works

User enters a city name.
The program sends a GET request to the OpenWeather API using the provided API key.
The API returns JSON data containing weather details.
The data is parsed and displayed in a clean, formatted output with emojis 🌡️🌧️

🧠 Example Output
=== 🌦️ Weather App ===
Enter city name (or 'exit' to quit): Karachi

🌍 Location: Karachi, PK
🌡️ Temperature: 32°C
🤔 Feels Like: 36°C
☁️ Weather: clear sky

🛠️ Error Handling

If an invalid city name or API issue occurs, the program displays a clean error message instead of crashing:
❌ City not found or API error. Please try again.
